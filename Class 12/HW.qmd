>Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their
corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

##A: sample size:
A|A = 108, A|G = 283, G|G = 121
medians:
A|A = 31.2, A|G = 25.06, G|G = 20.07

```{r}
data = read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(data)
```
```{r}
summary(data)
sampsize <- table(data$geno)
print(sampsize)
```

```{r}
median <- tapply(data$exp,data$geno,median)
print(median)
```
>Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the
expression of ORMDL3?

A: From the boxplot, it appears that there is less expression of G|G relative to A|A. Since there is this drop in expression between A|A and G|G, it's obvious that any SNPS will decrease the expression of the gene.
```{r}
bp <- boxplot(exp ~ geno, data=data, main = "Boxplot")
```
