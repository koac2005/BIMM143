#First what is in the PDB database - the main repository of protein structures

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("PDBstats.csv", row.names = 1)
x <- stats$X.ray
x
stats
```
```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", stats$EM))
sum()
```
```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x) {
  as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
}
rm.comma(stats$EM)
```
#I can use apply to fix the entire table
```{r}
pdbstats <- apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
pdbstats
```

```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)
round(totals/totals["Total"]*100,2)
```

A: 84.83% is solved by X-Ray, 8.33% is solved by EM


>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
pdbstats
proteinsum <- pdbstats[1, "Total"]
round(pdbstats[1, "Total"]/sum(pdbstats[, "Total"]) *100)
```
A: 87%

>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

skip this one

```{r}

```

Here is a lovely figure of HIP-Pr with the catalytic ASP residues, the MK1 compund, and the all important water 308



>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

A: the hydrogen molecules are so small that they are almost insignificant and thus are not needed to be displayed in the structure

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?

A: HOH 308

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.
